# Defines Producer Configuration

# Loads the following (first-listed are higher priority):
# system properties
# application.conf (all resources on classpath with this name)
# application.json (all resources on classpath with this name)
# application.properties (all resources on classpath with this name)
# reference.conf (all resources on classpath with this name)
# This is the reference config file that contains all the default settings.

# Make your edits/overrides in your application.conf.

# ${?property.name} allows the producer to override using a system property or environmnet variable
# property will only be set if a value exists
